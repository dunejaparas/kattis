General Submission Guideline



You submissions are executed in a *NIX type environment. Assume software/shells etc are in their standard locations. 
Nothing else.

All programs should return a zero exit code on success.

Java/Scala Devs - Ensure your classname matches the program name eg. fizzbuzz,spiral_printing, robot_movements etc.




Question 1: Parenthesis 

Given a string made up of the following 6 characters ( ) { } [ ] determine if it is well-formed or not. 
Well-formed meaning Parentheses, braces and brackets match in nested pairs.



Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file contains a string 
comprising the characters mentioned above. e.g.


({[()]})

([)]


Print out True or False if the string is well-formed e.g. for the example above:
True
False



Question 2: Reverse and Add



The problem is as follows: choose a number, reverse its digits and add it to the original. 
If the sum is not a palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right to left), repeat this procedure. eg.

195 (initial number) + 591 (reverse of initial number) = 786

786 + 687 = 1473

1473 + 3741 = 5214

5214 + 4125 = 9339 (palindrome)

In this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after the 4th addition. 
This method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. But there are interesting exceptions. 
196 is the first number for which no palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there is no such a palindrome.



Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file is one test case. 
Each test case will contain an integer n < 4,294,967,295. Assume each test case will always have an answer and that it is computable 
with less than 1000 iterations (additions)

For each line of input, generate a line of output which is the number of iterations (additions) to compute the palindrome
 and the resulting palindrome. (they should be on one line and separated by a single space character)




First submission is considered final
